# Theory Answers for MedicalExpertSystem:

# 1. What is an expert system? How does this program simulate one?
# Ans: An expert system is a computer program that mimics the decision-making ability of a human expert. 
# This program simulates one by using a rule-based approach to ask symptom-related questions and provide diagnosis accordingly.

# 2. How are rule-based systems implemented in Python?
# Ans: Rule-based systems use conditional statements (if-elif-else) to apply logical rules based on user input. 
# In this program, rules are coded to match specific symptom combinations to diagnoses.

# 3. What is the difference between physical and mental symptoms in diagnosis?
# Ans: Physical symptoms are bodily discomforts like fever or pain, while mental symptoms relate to emotional or psychological conditions like sadness or anxiety. 
# The system separates them to ask more relevant questions and improve accuracy.

# 4. How does conditional logic help in medical decision-making?
# Ans: Conditional logic allows mapping certain symptoms to specific conditions. 
# This helps in providing preliminary diagnoses based on known symptom patterns.

# 5. Can this system be extended using machine learning? If yes, how?
# Ans: Yes. We can collect labeled symptom-diagnosis data and train a classifier (like Decision Tree or Naive Bayes) 
# to predict diagnoses automatically rather than using fixed rules.

# 6. How can user input validation be improved in such expert systems?
# Ans: By ensuring that the user can only enter valid inputs (e.g., using menus, dropdowns, or input sanitization), 
# we reduce errors and improve the systemâ€™s reliability.

# 7. What are the limitations of using only yes/no questions in diagnosis?
# Ans: Yes/no questions limit the detail and context of user input. 
# They may not capture symptom severity, duration, or additional symptoms, which can lead to incorrect or vague diagnoses.

# 8. Explain the concept of forward chaining and how it could be used here.
# Ans: Forward chaining is a reasoning method that starts with known facts (symptoms) and applies rules to infer conclusions (diagnosis). 
# This system already uses a simple form of forward chaining with if-else rules based on user input.

# 9. How would you store and manage symptoms and diagnoses for a large-scale system?
# Ans: For large-scale systems, symptoms and diagnoses should be stored in a database. 
# We can also use JSON/XML or ontology-based representations for structured and scalable knowledge bases.

# 10. What ethical considerations should be kept in mind while designing medical expert systems?
# Ans: The system must clarify that it's not a substitute for professional medical advice. 
# User data privacy, accuracy of diagnosis, and handling of sensitive mental health data must be carefully managed.
