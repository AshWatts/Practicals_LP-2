'''
1. Approach

Language: Python â€“ clean recursion, easy state tracking.

Problem: Place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Techniques:

Backtracking: Explore possibilities row-by-row, backtrack on conflicts.

Branch and Bound: Improve efficiency by pruning branches using bounding conditions (e.g., tracking columns and diagonals).

2. Theory

N-Queens Problem:
Goal: Place n queens on an n x n board so that no two queens threaten each other (same row, column, or diagonal).

Type: Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

Constraints:

Only one queen per row.

No two queens on same column or diagonal.

Backtracking:
Idea: Try placing a queen row-by-row.

If a conflict occurs, backtrack and try another column.

Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n!)

Branch and Bound:
Idea: Prune branches early using bounding conditions (e.g., used columns and diagonals).

Improvement over pure backtracking: Avoid exploring obviously invalid states.

Applications:
Chess engines

Scheduling

Puzzle solving
